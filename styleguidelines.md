TridentSDK Style Guidelines
====
This document specifies the style specifications that should be followed when contributing code to Trident/TridentSDK.

Unless otherwise specified below, we follow [Google's Java Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) style.

In addition to the above link, below is a brief summary of the key points and changes.

## Format

- 4 space indentation. Do not use tabs
- 80 character limit per line
- K & R Style brackets
- The copyright notice appears at the very top of the file, followed by an empty line, followed by the package
- No whitespace between first field declaration and class declaration
- Always include ```@author The TridentSDK Team``` as the last item in the class javadoc
- Indent as specified in ยง4 of the Google Style Guidelines (except indentation is 4 spaces instead of 2).
- No whitespace after closing brace of class, no empty line before closing brace.
- New line after ```;```, do not put multiple statements on one line, except for ```for``` statements
- Keywords and braces have whitespace around them
- All operators have surrounding whitespace
- All ```for``` statements have whitespace after the ```;```, always have whitespace after commas ```,```

## Naming

- Managers or handling classes are named ```{Function}Handler```
- Package names are always lowercase
- **NEVER** use underscores ```_``` except for ```CONSTANT_FIELDS``` and enumerations
- Use shortened field names sparingly
- Abbreviations allowed for local variables
- Classes start with a capital, each word starts with a capital
- Class names that contain an abbreviation are discouraged, except for common abbreviations
- Abbreviations follow standard Camel-case (e.g. ID becomes id or Id, HTTP becomes http or Http, etc.)
- Interfaces have the same casing and rules as class names
- Constants declared static and final, and their names must be all uppercase, with underscores separating words
- Methods and fields use lowercase first letter, and capitalized first letter for every following word

## Technical Design

- Thread safe classes use static factories
- Immutable classes marked with ```@ThreadSafe```
- Use ```@GuardedBy``` annotations if synchronization is used
- **API METHODS MUST BE THREAD SAFE**
- Fields made final whenever it possible
- Initialize as soon as possible, unless object contains heavy computation. Mark for discussion.

## Documentation

- Should be in the following format: description, whitespace, then tags
- Only field comments are allowed to be single line comments
- Overridden methods do not need documentation, as long as the superclass/superinterface is documented
- Classes are always documented unless they are package private
- Package private classes are marked with ```@AccessNoDoc```. Do not document them.
- ```@InternalUseOnly``` members may not be documented, should not be used in API classes/interfaces
- All packages must include a ```package-info.html``` to describe/list classes in that package
- API documentation should not include implementation details
- Use ```@Volatile``` to document an unstable or non-conventional usage of a particular member
- Prefer ```@throws``` over ```@exception```, and ```@code``` over ```<code>```
- First mention of another class that is in Trident or TridentSDK should be linked
- Java keywords should have ```@code``` tags
- Document return of null, or possible usage of null in parameters

## Practices
- Use ```this``` qualifiers for method calls or field references, where it improves readablity
- Do not qualify ```this``` for inner classes, as it generates ```{Enclosing class}.this.{reference}```
- Static qualifiers are not needed if used inside the class (e.g. INFO instead of TridentServer.INFO inside the class TridentServer)
- Use parentheses when they improve readability or provide clarity
- Any ignored (swallowed) exceptions must be commented to explain why
- Use ```TridentLogger.error(Exception)``` when handling exceptions
- Any empty conditionals must have a comment explaining why they are empty
