/**
 * A fast random class which generates medium-quality pseudo-random values
 *
 * <p>Normally such a class should have been implemented upon using the time system with currentTimeMills(), however
 * this was avoided for two reasons:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Security - If the timer did not update in time, a malicious user may use that same random. While this is not
 * designed as a cryptographically secure random, malice is a strong enough reason to use nanoTime()</li>
 * <li>Randomness - Using successive calls to this random may produce the same random number. The occurrance of this
 * depends on the overhead of the method call, in which case a full millisecond has not passed yet, rather than the
 * possibility that the timer has not updated (which again, is another plausible reason for this)</li>
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the methods which produce a random using the hash is not a seed. The next number is never ever
 * consistent unless nanoTime returns the same value and the hashed object is the same. The methods which do not
 * provide
 * a hash do not create a new object, rather it does not hash the nanoTime at all.</p>
